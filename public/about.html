<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am a student from APU and I am currently taking Diploma in Information Communications & Technology with a specialism in Data Informatics. I have a passion for coding and computer science because I can earn a lot of money with it and because I find coding fun! Coding allows me to create things that I always wanted to. It comes with the side-effects of carpal tunnel and perpetual depression, but it's fun to create things!</p>
<p>I am an avid debater and I love watching anime. I can also speak Japanese and I would love to make new friends with Japanese people! I play the piano, knit, crochet and cook as well. That makes me sound like a grandma... But I don't mind! A grandma is someone that's nice and welcoming, so if that reflects who I am, I would be happy to be a grandma!</p>
<p>I hope to one day travel to Japan and Korea. I love the infrastructure and quality of life there, although the economy may be bad. It seems like a really nice place and the four seasons are really cool in my opinion. I hope to some day land a job there and be able to experience life in those two countries!</p>
